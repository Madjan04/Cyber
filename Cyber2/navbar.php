As you can see, this is the website's home page. On the top left side, there are five (5) navigation buttons; the first is "Store," where you can see the various digital games that are available on the website, and the second is "FAQ," or "frequently asked questions," where developers will type in the most frequently asked questions along with the answers that players most often ask. 

You can also see the HELP button, where these guidelines will be inserted, and the ABOUT CYBER+ button, in which you can see the relevant information about the website's developers, when this was created, as well as what year it was published to the community, whereas the REGISTER AND SIGN IN buttons are on the right side.

 If you click the register button, that means you will be directed to a page where you will create a new account since you do not have one yet. After completing the required information, you can progress to the sign-in button and fill in your username along with the password you created. </p>

Upon completing all of the required information and verifying that there are no errors, you can tap the "sign up" button, and your account will be created. </p>
